## Problem Statement

For this project I must ***create a data*** set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choosing. The phenomenon can be selected according to my preferences and can be of interest to me in my personal or professional life. Instead of collecting data related to the phenomenon, I should model and synthesize my data using python. 

Sepecifically, in this problem I should:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which I could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

- Detail myr research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
